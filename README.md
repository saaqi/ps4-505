# PS4 5.05 Lightweight Exploit Host

This is a small, lightweight exploit host for PlayStation 4 systems running firmware **5.05**.

I built this mainly for my own use as a clean, no-frills alternative to larger or more feature-heavy hosts. It’s designed to be easy to run locally, quick to load in the PS4 browser, and simple to maintain.

## Features

- Minimal and lightweight setup
- Fast-loading exploit pages
- Local hosting (no external dependencies required)
- Easy to modify or extend for personal needs

## Notes

- This project targets **PS4 firmware 5.05 only**
